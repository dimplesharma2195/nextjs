# React Router Link vs Anchor Tag

## Questions & Answers

### Why is anchor tag not the best way to redirect new links?
The anchor tag (`<a>`) causes a full page reload when navigating between pages in a React application. This means:
- The entire application state is lost
- All JavaScript assets need to be reloaded and re-executed
- It creates a slower, less smooth user experience
- It defeats the purpose of having a Single Page Application (SPA)

### What is the alternative to `<a>` tag?
The alternative is the `Link` component provided by React Router. This is specifically designed for SPAs to handle client-side routing.

### What do you think Link tag actually is?
The `Link` component is a wrapper around the HTML `<a>` tag that:
- Intercepts the default browser navigation behavior (prevents the page reload)
- Uses the History API to update the URL in the browser
- Tells React Router to render the appropriate component based on the new URL
- Maintains your application state during navigation
- Under the hood, it still renders as an `<a>` tag in the DOM but with custom event handlers

In essence, it's a "smarter" version of the anchor tag that works with React Router to provide seamless client-side navigation without full page reloads.
